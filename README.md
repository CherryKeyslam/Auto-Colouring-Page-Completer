# Auto-Colouring-Page-Completer
Completes colouring pages made for children or adults.

Best works with less than 

- 800x800 resolution

- colouring pages with fixed borders

- asymmetrical images.

To operate it:

- After downloading the python file,

- Create a folder named "to_colour"

- And another one named "coloured" in the same place as the python file

- Place the images you want to colour in the "to_colour" folder.

- and run the program! The coloured pictures will appear in the "coloured" folder.

And of course, as some prerequisites , you need to download python 3 or above and the PIL/pillow module.
