# Auto-Colouring-Page-Completer
Completes colouring pages made for children or adults.

Best works with less than 

- 800x800 resolution

- colouring pages with fixed, dark borders

To operate it:

- You need to download python 3 or above and the PIL/pillow module.

- Download **this** python file

- Create a folder named "to_colour" in the same place as the python file

- And another one named "coloured"

- Place the images you want to colour in the "to_colour" folder.

- and run the program! The coloured pictures will appear in the "coloured" folder.
